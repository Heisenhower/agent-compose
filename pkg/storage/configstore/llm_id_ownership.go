// envProjectionConflict reports the first provider or model id the daemon
// environment projection would take over from another configuration source. It
// reads inside the projection transaction, so ownership cannot change between
// the check and the upsert that follows it.
//
// The report yields the whole projection, not just the offending id. That is
// deliberate when the conflict is the model: another source already serves the
// model the environment names, so the environment connection has nothing left
// to add, and creating it anyway would only make the two endpoints peers in
// connection selection, where one is picked at random.
//
// A declared id is owned for as long as its row carries the declaring scope, even
// though a provider declaration without an apiKey is persisted disabled. The file
// projection rewrites a provider row only while the row still carries the catalog
// scope, so taking that id over made the next startup's file projection match no
// row and fail with a non-catalog conflict; loadLLMConfig failed with it, and the
// daemon started without its cleanup, scheduler, and deletion recovery managers on
// every start.
//
// A model identity is only an owner while an enabled connection actually binds
// it. An identity alone answers no request, so a models.json that declares a
// connection without a credential — persisted disabled — must not suppress the
// environment bootstrap: yielding to it left a deployment with no enabled
// connection at all, and runs silently lost the daemon-managed credential even
// though the environment was the only source that could serve the model. Taking
// the identity over stays symmetric, because the file projection reclaims an
// identity the bootstrap materialized (CatalogProjectionOwnsScope).
//
// A row the file stops declaring loses that scope: the projection releases it, and
// the environment bootstrap maintains an unset scope. So a stale row cannot keep
// owning an id the file has moved on from, and the bootstrap recovers by itself
// instead of yielding to a source that will never rewrite the row again. The file
// projection is symmetric in the other direction — it rewrites the rows this
// bootstrap maintains as well (see CatalogProjectionOwnsScope) — so an id the
// environment materialized, including one it took over after a release, comes back
// under the file the moment the file declares it again.
